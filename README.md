# Cholesterol-Prediction
Cholesterol Level Prediction using Linear Regression
Academic Project | Tools: Microsoft Excel, Statistical Modeling

Conducted a regression-based predictive analysis to estimate cholesterol levels using health-related variables such as age, cigarette consumption, BMI, diastolic BP, heart rate, and glucose levels.

Built multiple linear regression models and evaluated them using R-squared values (0.07) and residual analysis to understand model accuracy and prediction error.

Performed normality tests, descriptive statistics, and created a correlation matrix to examine relationships between predictors and cholesterol levels.

Interpreted data insights to understand health trends and risk factors influencing cholesterol, enhancing statistical thinking and Excel-based analytical skills.
